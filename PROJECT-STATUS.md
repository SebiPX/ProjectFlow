## 🔐 Security Status

### API Security & Authentication: ✅ Correctly Implemented

The application now uses a custom middleware-based security approach instead of database RLS:

- ✅ **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication via `/api/auth/`
- ✅ **Authorization Middleware**: `requireAuth` and role-checks enforce access control at the route level.
- ✅ **Data Isolation**: API controllers filter queries by user role (Internal vs Client).
- ✅ **Passwords**: securely hashed using bcrypt on the backend.
- ✅ **Admin Controls**: Password resets and profile modifications restricted to `admin` role natively in the API.

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. RLS Policy Best Practice

**Don't query the same table from within its own RLS policy** - causes infinite recursion!

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Infinite recursion
CREATE POLICY "Admin access" ON profiles
  USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'));

-- ✅ GOOD: Simple, no recursion
CREATE POLICY "Own profile only" ON profiles
  USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

### 2. Two User Tables is Correct

- `auth.users` - Authentication (Supabase managed)
- `public.profiles` - Extended data (your data)
- Linked by `id`, synced with trigger

### 3. Always Include Metadata in Signup

```typescript
// ✅ Correct way
await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email,
  password,
  options: {
    data: { full_name: "User Name" }, // ← Required!
  },
});
```

### 4. Use Service Role Key for Admin Operations

Don't try to create RLS policies for admin access to all profiles - use service role key in backend operations instead.

### 5. React Query is Your Friend

- Automatic caching and revalidation
- Loading and error states handled
- Optimistic updates easy to implement
- Background refetching
